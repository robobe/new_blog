# ROS2 
What, Why and basic verbs and concept

![](ros_idea.png)

---

# What
 - Open source software development kit for robotics applications.
 - Standard
 - From research and prototyping through to deployment and production

- For me it a STANDARD

---

# Verbs
- DDS
- Node
- Pub / Sub
- Service
- Action
- Parameters

---

# Tools
- Rqt
- Rviz
- Gazebo

---

# What to remember
- ROS2 is a standard
  - Don't invite the wheel
- It's all about Nodes and messages

---

# DDS
DDS (Data Distribution Service) is an open-standard connectivity framework for real-time systems
