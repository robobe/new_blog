**FuncAnimation** is Matplotlib’s built-in way to make animations. You give it:

- a Figure to draw on,
- an update function that changes existing artists (lines, scatters, images) for each frame,
- an optional init function to set the starting state,
- and frames (how many frames or an iterable of frame values).

It repeatedly calls your update function and redraws.

```python

```

!!! Note
    The callable `update` must return an `iterable` of artist when `blit=True`
