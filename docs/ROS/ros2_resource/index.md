### [Autonomous Mobile Robots](https://github.com/Walid-khaled/autonomous_mobile_robots)
This repository contains an implementation of the Autonomous Mobile Robots course for ROCV master's program at Innopolis University. The course is instructed by Geesara Prathap. So, this repository contains the course material besides my solutions for the assignments. In addition, I developed PID, LQR controllers for a differential drive robot. Trajectory-tracking error model was developed for applying MPC controller.

The course contents includes:

- Motion control (Kinematics, control, and dubins path planning).
- Estimation (Kalman filter, extended kalman filter, particle filter).
- Localization (Monte carlo, and ekf localization).
