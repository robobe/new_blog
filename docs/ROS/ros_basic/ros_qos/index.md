# Playing with ROS QoS


| QoS Parameter | Description | Options|
| ------------  | ----------  | ------ |
| Reliability|	Defines message delivery guarantees	| **RELIABLE** (guaranteed delivery, higher latency)  **BEST_EFFORT** (lower latency, no guarantee) |
| Durability|	Determines if old messages are available to late subscribers |	**VOLATILE** (no history, new subscribers get only new messages)   **TRANSIENT_LOCAL** (stores past messages for late joiners)
| History|	Controls how many messages are stored before being sent	|**KEEP_LAST(N)** (stores last N messages)  **KEEP_ALL** (stores all messages, limited by memory) |
| Depth |	Number of messages to store in KEEP_LAST(N)	| Any positive integer (default 10)|
| Deadline|	Maximum allowed time between consecutive messages	| Duration (e.g., 1s, 500ms); triggers an event if missed|
| Lifespan|	How long messages remain valid before being discarded	| Duration in sec (default infinity)|
| Liveliness|	Ensures publishers are active| **AUTOMATIC** (system-managed) **MANUAL_BY_TOPIC**  (publisher must assert liveliness)|
| Lease  Duration |	Maximum time a publisher can remain silent before being considered inactive	| Duration (e.g., 2s, 5s)|


## Profiles

## Demos
### Publisher Queue size
Simulate publisher queue size control for late binding subscribers


#### qos_profile_system_default
In this profile the depth is zero and from result we saw that the subscribe not receives any message from history

<details>
    <summary>demo code</summary>
```python
--8<-- "docs/ROS/ros_basic/ros_qos/code/pub_qos_queue_system_profile.py"

#### qos_profile_sensor_data
In this profile the depth set to **5** but the the durability set to **VOLATILE** (no history, new subscribers get only new messages), the result saw that late subscriber got only new messages

#### Queue and Durability
Allow late subscriber to get history


- Durability: **TRANSIENT_LOCAL** stores past messages for late joiners
- depth: 10
  
**Subscriber QOS settings**
The **queue depth** in the subscriber refer to the number of messages the subscriber can store before processing them
The durability must be transient local because in **VOLATILE** means it **won't receive old message**

- depth: 10
- durability: **TRANSIENT_LOCAL** 
  
<details>
    <summary>demo code</summary>

```python
--8<-- "docs/ROS/ros_basic/ros_qos/code/pub_qos_queue_and_transient_local.py"
```
</details>

From the result we saw that we got five (0-4) message from publisher history in the same time slot almost

### Publisher livespan
Controls how long a message remains valid in the publisherâ€™s queue before it is discarded.

lifespan = {0,0} default message never expire store until queue is exceeded

<details>
    <summary>demo code</summary>

!!! note "duration"
     Change `DURATION` at line 20 to simulate different duration behavior

```python
--8<-- "docs/ROS/ros_basic/ros_qos/code/pub_qos_queue_and_lifespan.py"
```

The subscriber start 5 sec after the publisher because the publisher message duration is 5 sec  
The subscriber got all the message history

The demo code stop to publish after 5 sec, the subscriber trigger the deadline_missed_callback callback

!!! note 

     The publisher rate and deadline both are 1 hz,
     the alert in line 6,8 occurs because the narrower delta

## Liveliness
Use liveliness if you need to detect dead or disconnected publishers (e.g., checking if a node is still online).

!!! note "deadline"
    Check that message are received on time
